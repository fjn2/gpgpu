# GP GPU

The idea of this repository is to create an easy way to generate calculations in the GPU



### Actual state

There is a function to multiply two numbers. But the performance is too slow.

There is no way to pass to the GPU a custom function to evaluate

Also, It is not posible make operation with two numbers. Ie: 3x2
